## Requirements

- [SilverWare][silverware]
- [SilverWare Navigation Module][silverware-navigation]

## Installation

Installation is via [Composer][composer]:

```
$ composer require silverware/search
```

## Configuration

As with all SilverStripe modules, configuration is via YAML.
Frontend requirements for `ContentController` are applied via `config.yml`.
Style mappings for Bootstrap are configured in the `styles.yml` configuration file.

## Usage

This module provides a `SearchResultsPage` which will be created automatically upon
build. This page is a dedicated page for showing search results generated by SilverStripe's
built-in fulltext search.

Also provided is a `SearchItem` object which can be added as a child of the `BarNavigation`
component provided by the [SilverWare Navigation][silverware-navigation] module. This item
adds a search icon to your navbar which shows a search form popover upon click.

On small screen devices, the icon and popover are hidden, and instead the search form is
added directly into the collapsible navigation area.
